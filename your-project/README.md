## Project Description
I chose the Hangman game because it's a game I know very well and the rules are very simple. In this game the user has to guess a word by introducing the possible letters that build the word, only having 7 tries.

## Rules
The goal is to guess the word to save the hangman from death. Enter one letter at a time to see if itâ€™s in the word. If you have guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the blank spaces. If the letter is not in the word, you loose a life. The initial number of lifes is 7. If the word is not guessed before spending all 7 lifes, the game ends and you loose. If you guess the whole word, you win!


## Workflow
The development of the game was divided in steps:
- Game choice: I chose one of the possibilities given.
- Download files: I cloned the repo from github.
- Research: I visited the link of the game, read the rules and played for a while to understand the behaviour of the programm.
- Pseudocode: I wrote a pseudocode for the programm.
- Code: whole code writing.
- Test: I tried out the game several times in all its possibilities to confirm it worked correctly.
- Update Readme and create .gitignore.
- Preparation of presentation.


## Organization
To organize my work I used a trello board, in which I created several cards with the different tasks.

My repo is in a folder which includes 3 files: .gitignore, README.md, and Hangman.ipynb. It also includes a folder called .ipynb_checkpoints.
