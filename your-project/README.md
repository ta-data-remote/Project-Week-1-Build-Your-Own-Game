## Project Description

In this first project of the **Data Analytics Bootcamp** we will create a basic game software from scratch, applying the knowledge about *Python functions* we were learning during the first week.

I’ve chosen the game named **Soldier & Dice, as well known as Risk**, because this was my favourite board game since I was a child, and I thought It would be a beautiful challenge for me.

## Rules

Risk is a classic board game where two or more armies **will fight in order to dominate the whole world** reflected in the board by **continents and countries**. 

**To fight** against the player who controls a territory beside yours, **you have to roll any number of dices according with the number of soldiers you have**in the attacking territory.

The defender player will roll some dices to defend, and then **the  values between the biggest dices will be compared** in order to determine who is the winner and if the territory is conquered.


## Workflow

First of all, I must **adapt the rules of the original game for more simplified ones**, ir order to code an usable software for this occasion.

I’ve started simplifying the experience of the game into the main basic feature of the game: fighting with dices.

Starting from a basic software of **generating random values for the dices**, the workflow was improving the game experience, including an input for the user, sophisticating the inner code and the visual result, and adding some funny different responses for every possible outcome.

The last step was **checking some bugs and errors** in the program.



## Organization

First of all, I’ve planned my work with a ***Kanban board** using the platform named Trello. There, you can plan every task of the project beforehand and set some deadlines for each one.

I’ve created this **GitHub repository**, including an updated Readme.md file and a .gitigonore file, well structured and functional.
