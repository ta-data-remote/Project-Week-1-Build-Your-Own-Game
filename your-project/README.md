## Project Description
I chose the Hangman game because it's a game I know very well and the rules are very simple. In this game the user has to guess a word by introducing the possible letters that build the word, only having 7 tries.

## Rules
The goal is to guess the word to save the hangman from death. Enter one letter at a time to see if it’s in the word. If you have guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the blank spaces. If the letter is not in the word, you loose a life. The initial number of lifes is 7. If the word is not guessed before spending all 7 lifes, the game ends and you loose. If you guess the whole word, you win!


## Workflow
The development of the game was divided in steps:
- Game choice: I chose one of the possibilities given.
- Download files: I cloned the repo from github.
- Research: I visited the link of the game, read the rules and played for a while to understand the behaviour of the programm.
- Pseudocode: I wrote a pseudocode for the programm.
- Code: whole code writing.
- Test: I tried out the game several times in all its possibilities to confirm it worked correctly.
- Update Readme and create .gitignore.
- Preparation of presentation.


## Organization
To organize my work I used a trello board, in which I created several cards with the different tasks.
