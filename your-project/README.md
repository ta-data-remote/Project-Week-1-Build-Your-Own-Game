## Project Description
This is a classic hangman game with a German twist. All words that you have to guess are in German and extremely hard.

## Rules
You have to guess the letter or the complete word in order to win.
As long as your guess is right you can keep on guessing. However you only have 5 wrong guesses before you loose the game. Don't worry, you can play again!

## Workflow
First I researched the game and played it a couple of times to outlines the rules and exceptions.
Then I started to organize my trello board, to see which tasks I need to finish (and by when) in order to have all things needed for the project.
After that I wrote my pseudocode to figure out what type of functions I will be needing for my game. I added the functions to my trello board to not loose oversight.
I started to build my git repo by forking the TA's repo, adding a gitignore and making sure it looks nice and clean.
After all the organizing I started to code.
During the coding I tested many of my gaming options to not miss any case.
After the raw version of the code was finished, I started testing for bugs, exceptions and to "prettyfie" the game adding breaks and timing.
After finalizing everything I made my presentation and added the updated readme file.


## Organization
I organised my project with trello into tasks which are either in progress, almost done , done or in review. I also assigned deadlines to some tasks in order to be reminded.

I tried to keep it as clean and lean as possible, so it contains a gitignore, a readme, my code in a jupyter notebook, as well as my code in .py file so people can run it on their terminal.
