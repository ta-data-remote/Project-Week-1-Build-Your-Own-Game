## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to apply the knowledge from the first week of the bootcamp. I chose Hangman because it applies many of the commands from the past lessons in an interesting way, like: 
- keeping track of guessed letters in lists
- using sets for unique letters in a word in case there are duplicates of the same letter in a word
- replacing underscores with values and defining how the game is lost or won

## Rules

- You have to guess a letter to find the random word the game has chosen
- Everytime you guess a correct letter the game will show you at which location this letter is located within the word
- If your guess is wrong you loose one life
- You have 5 lives to guess the letter and win the game

## Workflow

My first step was to plan when I wanted to be finished with which part of the project. After deciding my deadlines I started
a list of steps I would have to follow for the game as a rough overview. I also noted some challenges where I could run into
difficulties and additional functions for my game. I save my project in a designated project folder in my working directory, work
on the files with Jupyter Notebooks and upload the changes on github. 

## Organization

I used a Kanban board to keep track of my tasks for the project. I also noted down my rough coding steps in the same board. 
I organize my projects for the data analytics project
