## Project Description
I chose to create the Blackjack game since I wanted to use code using a dictionary. The dictionary I used in this instance was the deck of cards.

## Rules
The game is simple: each card has a power. You start with 2 cards and are given the option to get more cards.. 
Your score is the sum of the card powers you have. Your score should be as closest possible to the number 21. if you exceed you lose

## Workflow
I started with defining functions to the main actions of the game which are:
* shuffeling
* dealing
* hitting and standing
* ace power


## Organization
I used a kanban board to track my progress but most of the work was
my repo includes this readme file, the .gitignore file, and a folder that contains the jupyter_notebook file.
