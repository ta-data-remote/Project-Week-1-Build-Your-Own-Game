## Project Description
In this game the player will have to guess a randomly selected number within the range 1 - 20. I think is a game that everyone can play, since it extremly simple to play.

## Rules
The player will have input 5 guesses in the game.

## Workflow
First I took the time to think what is important in this project, which information do I need to give the player and how to code the program. After having an general idea, I started with a plan and a pseudocode, which I later converted into a code. Test runs to see if the game works.

## Organization
I used Trello to outline the deadlines, using the template provided.

My code is in the folder "your-project"
