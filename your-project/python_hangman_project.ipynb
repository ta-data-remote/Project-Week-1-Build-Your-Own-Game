    "The purpose of this project is to apply the knowledge from the python lectures from the first week of the bootcamp. I chose the Hangman because it applies many of the commands from the past lessons in an interesting way: keeping track of guessed letters in lists, using sets for unique letters in a word in case there are duplicates of the same letter in a word. Replacing underscores with values and defining how the game is lost or won."
