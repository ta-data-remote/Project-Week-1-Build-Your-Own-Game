# # The German Hangman Game
# Here you will find my awesome code for the ultrahard German Hangman Game.

# In[1]:


# START GAME
# user input "name" > all characters can be accepted
# print "Hi "name", are you ready to get owned by German Hangman?"
# wait 2 seconds, start game

# CHOOSE RANDOM WORD
# get a random word from word_list
# convert all words from word_list to upper case 
# store word in variable "word"

# GAMEPLAY FUNCTION
# set 10 tries (user can guess as much as he wants, but fail only 10 times)
# display the length of "word" to the user with _ _ _ underscores
# Hidden letters are shown as underscores, guessed letters will be unmasked
# prompt the user to guess a letter or word 
    # user input convert to uppercase always
# while loop until word is guessed or user runs out of tries
    # letter is in secret word > show letter in secret word, ask for user input again, show remaining tries, print "Nice try!"
    # letter is not in secret word > -1 try and ask for user input again, show remaining tries, print "This letter is not in the word, try again!"
# if user runs out of tries (10) and looses:
    # secret word is displayed, print ""name" you loose, guess you got owned by German hangman", start play again function
# if user wins or guesses the word right
    # word is displayed, print ""name" you win, you are ready to move to Berlin now!", start play again function
     
# PLAY AGAIN FUNCTION
# print "Are you ready to play again?"
# print "enter "Y" to start "N" 
    # make sure that only Y and N is possible (not weird other input > error message " wow you are already failing here"
    # gameplay function starts again

# possible problems with user input > error messages:
    # not a letter
    # same letter twice (show the user which letters he already used?)
