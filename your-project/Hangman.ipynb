    "The goal is to guess the word to save the hangman from death. Enter one letter at a time to see if itâ€™s in the word. If you have guessed correctly, the letter will appear in the blank spaces. If the letter is not in the word, you loose a life. The initial number of lifes is 7. If the word is not guessed before spending all 7 lifes, the game ends and you loose. If you guess the whole word, you win!!"
