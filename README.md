## Project Description

In this project I will create a version of the hangman game called "The hangfolk vlau.0". It is a really funny game that I used to play at school when I was a child on the board. My own version will make it even more fun (specially after all the work behind)!

## Rules

This game consists in guessing an unknown word picked randomly from a list of words. I will provide three topics to choose.
In each turn the player will pick a letter that, hopefully, the unknown word will contain. If this is the case, it will be shown on screen in which position is located together with a list of letters that have been already used.Â 
The player has 11 lives. That mean that you can just be wrong with your letter this amount of time, or you will be hanged!

## Workflow

The general workflow is the following:
- The player is welcome.
- The player inputs a letter.
- This word is added to the a list of already used letters.
- A display is generated showing the encrypted word and the list of letters that the player have already used.
- If the letter chosen by the player was in the word it will be placed in its correct position on the word display.
- The game will ask the player to input more letters until all letters are guessed or the player failes 11(the number of lives you will start with) times in guessing a letter.
- The game is finshed and a message is shown to see if the player has won.


## Organization

**Phases of the project**

I have used a Trello board to organize my tasks. They where organized is three phases:

- The first phase was for creating the kanban board with all tasks required and set flexible deadlines. It was as well the moment to start with the design of the game an the pseudocode.

- The second one for finished the pseudocode and started coding. 

- The third phase to review the code, test the game, debug and prepare the presentation.

If I have extra time, I will implement extra fun on my game.

**The repository**

The repository includes this Readme file and a gitignote. Inside of the folder your code, it includes a python file with the script of the game, a jupyter notebook where the code is commented, and 3 text files whith the lists f word for the 3 topics provided.
