## Project Description <a class="anchor" id="project-description"></a>
This project is a simple random password generator, which lets you decide the length and the type of characters. This project was chosen as password generators are useful and always in need.

## Rules <a class="anchor" id="rules"></a>
To use this generator the user has to make inputs regarding the length, and if the password should contain letters, numbers and/or symbols.

## Workflow <a class="anchor" id="workflow"></a>
The first step was to research different possibilities on random choice in python. After getting basic knowledge and a quick brainstorming the kanban board was created on Notion and the required steps were written down. Afterwards all needed code snippets were written into the Jupyter Notebook and after several trial and errors the first working code was created. 

## Organization <a class="anchor" id="organization"></a>
The organization of the work occured on Notion and manually on paper for quick notes. 

The repository contains a folder named "your-code" a README file and also a gitignore file. The "your-code" folder contains the Jupyter file with the password generator.
