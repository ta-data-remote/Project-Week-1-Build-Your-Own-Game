## Project Description
This project is intended to simulate the game "guess a number", in which the player has to guess a number from 1 to 100 within a limited number of attempts. For using the project the package "random" has been downloaded. 
## Rules
The rules of the game include the following requirements:
1. The number the player will guess is within the range of 1-100
2. The player has max. 7 tries to guess the number
3. The player must choose a number(not word)
## Workflow
1. Select game and research
2. Select steps in the game and structure code
3. Test code
4. Correct errors and finalise code 

## Organization
To organise myself, I used a kanban board, which helped me to get an overview of the individual tasks.
My repository contains my Jupiter notebook file, a .gitignore file and the read me file.
